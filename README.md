## Contributing
no thanks
but feel free to use it as a starting point in building your own configuration

## stuff to add

Octo
learn how to use the debug adapter protocol

## KEEP
cloak
trouble
lualine
harpoon

## MAYBE

add only treesitter
rawdog all code.... surely this will force me to learn, I will surely go back
but it could be important to appreciate, and more importantly understand exactly what 
I am outsourcing to open source.

## EXCLUDE
- copilot- using it for convenience at work is already  making me 
- lazy about actually learning SQL. hawk tuah
- consider NOT using a package manager -- lazy is sick though
- lsp-zero and just rawdawg the lsp config --illuminating issues with the ocaml lsp binary I've been having
should i exclude my formatter????????--- and force myself to stick to a format. 
will this make me pay more attention? or will it drain my focus from more significant cognitive tasks
-- do both, 2 weeks each, after which, analyze the tradeoffs, does the extra focus on detail speed up the rate at which I parse code over time?
-- choose that which you feel would be most advantagious
  


Planned implementation Christmas 2024
use nightly
use deprecations in packages as an opportunity to contribute
